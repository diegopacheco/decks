# Claude Code 

## Global Instructions

Global instructions will work for all directories, all sessions and all projects you do you in your machine with Claude Code. If I may draw a parallel this feature is the same as `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc` for Claude.

This file must be placed in `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` it control Claude code guidelines for all projects. Them you can write in any structure or format - instructions you want Claude to follow.
