### Enable WhatsApp iCloud backup on iPhone/iPad

On your iPhone:
```
• Open WhatsApp → Settings → Chats → Chat Backup.  ￼
• Tap Back Up Now to manually trigger a backup.  ￼
• Optionally, enable Auto Backup to have it back up at intervals (daily/weekly/monthly) if available.  ￼
• Make sure you’re signed into iCloud on your device, have iCloud Drive (or at least iCloud backup) enabled, and have sufficient iCloud storage.
