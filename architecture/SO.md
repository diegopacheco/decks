# Service Orientatation

Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) it's a big deal. SOA should be the default way or thinking and operating services in modern software architecture. Service Orientation should be the default choise for solutions. Services are more important and better than internal libraries. 

Services allow Isolation, Independence and Flexibility. When services are done right, with proper contracts, refactor can happen under the hood. Services allow different stacks and technology. 

Services sohuld be Capability oriented. Services should be as generic as possible and it's okay to have more granularity and more code in a service. Services does not need to be micro(Micro Services).
