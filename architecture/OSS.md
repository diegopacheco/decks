# Open Source First

Open Sorce must be the default. Avoid proprietary software. Do not build wrappers for open source libraries. Use Open Source software directly.Building internal shared libraries is a liability and will create many issues like security vulnerabilities, maintenance burden, and lack of community support / documentation. Thefore creating internal shared libraries must be a very consicous choise and must be well justified.
