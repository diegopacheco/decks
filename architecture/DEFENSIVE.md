# Defensive Programing

Defensive programming is a design approach that emphasizes anticipating and handling potential errors or unexpected inputs in software development. For instance you always:
* Validate inputs to ensure they meet expected formats and constraints.
* Handle exceptions gracefully to prevent crashes and provide meaningful error messages.
* Design functions and methods to be robust against invalid or unexpected inputs.

Your code should be resilient. It should not break that easily.
