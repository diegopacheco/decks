# Crystal Ball

Architects must have a good crystal ball. Requirements change, a requirement change can break completely the architecture if it was not designed to accommodate change. So thinking ahead it's a great pratice because allow you to predict the next moves, meaning you think big and ahead but execute small. 

Code can and should be refactored. Refactoring should happpen all the time and continously. However there are people who are alergic to refactoring and that is a recice to great disasters. Thinking ahead allow you to be prepared when you need it. Think about fire drills, you pratice how to handle fire, so when you need it you are ready. 

Think big execute small.
