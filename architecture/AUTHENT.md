# Authentication & Authorization & Entitlements

## Authentication

Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user or system. It ensures that the entity requesting access is who they claim to be. Common methods of authentication include:
- Passwords (very bad)
- Multi-factor authentication (MFA)
- Biometric verification
- OAuth tokens
- API keys
- Single Sign-On (SSO)

## Authorization

Authorization is the process of determining what an authenticated user or system is allowed to do. It defines the permissions and access levels for different resources. Common authorization models include:
- Access Control Lists (ACLs)
- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- IAM (Identity and Access Management) systems
- Policy-Based Access Control (PBAC)
- Policy as Code

## Entitlements

Entitlements refer to the specific rights or privileges granted to a user or system after authentication and authorization. They define what actions can be performed on specific resources. Examples of entitlements include:
- Access a product catalog (invisible by default)
- See premium content
- See premium features
