# Attention to Detail

Architects must be meticulous in their work, ensuring that every aspect of a design is carefully considered and executed. Attention to detail is crucial for creating functional, safe, and aesthetically pleasing structures. Here are some key areas where attention to detail is essential.

Architects pays close attention to:
* Code: Classes, Internal design, contracts, patterns/anti-patterns
* Tests: Are they passing?, how good they are? do we have good diversity? coverage?
* Production Logs: Are there any errors? warnings? anomalies?
* Production Dashboards: Are all metrics within expected ranges?
* Error Tracking: Are there any new issues? recurring issues? We should have ZERO EXCEPTIONS.
* Performance Metrics: Are we meeting our performance goals? any regressions?
* Security Audits: Are there any vulnerabilities? are we compliant with security standards?
* Requirements: Are we meeting all specified requirements? any missing features?

Architects are critical and detail-oriented when it comes to every since tech detail.
