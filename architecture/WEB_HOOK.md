# Web hook

A web hook it's just a endpoint in an API or REST server. A web hook is used to notify internal/external services when certain events happen. 

When an event occurs, the server makes an HTTP request (usually a POST request) to the specified URL of the web hook, sending relevant data about the event.

Web hooks are commonly used for:
* **Real-time notifications**: Informing external systems about events as they happen.
* **Data synchronization**: Keeping data in sync between different systems.
* **Integrations**: Connecting different services and automating workflows.

* **Event-driven architectures**: Triggering actions in response to specific events.

Webhooks dont require special technology, you can apply with any backend technology that can handle HTTP requests.
