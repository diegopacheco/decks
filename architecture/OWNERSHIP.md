# Ownership

Architects must have extreme ownership. They are responsible for the success and failure of the architecture they design. This includes:
* Ensuring the architecture meets business requirements.
* Continuously evaluating and improving the architecture.
* Collaborating with development teams to ensure proper implementation.
* Staying updated with industry trends and best practices.
* Documenting architectural decisions and their rationale.
* Advocating for the architecture within the organization.

Architects must be proatice. Architects are always:
* Thinking: Thinking ahead about future changes and how the architecture can accommodate them.
* Performing Research: Researching new technologies and patterns that can improve the architecture.
* Socializing: Communicating, educating, influencing effectively with stakeholders to ensure alignment and understanding of the architecture.
