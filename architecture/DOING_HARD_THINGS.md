# Doing Hard Things

Proper software is hard. It's a never ending war. Doing the right things means, teaching, socializing, influencing, enforcing, convicing, pushing back, standing your ground, and give all sweat and blood to make the right things to hapen.

The best things in sofware are HARD:
* Doing the right design
* Keeping discipline to wreite tests and have high diversity and coverage
* Calling out and teaching team members with poor pratices and worng belifs.
* Pushing back poorly written tickets and requirements
* Saying NO to "false shortcuts" (that lead to anti-patterns and tech debt)
* Doing the write things everyday (invisible ant work)

Architects must do HARD THINGS all the times.
