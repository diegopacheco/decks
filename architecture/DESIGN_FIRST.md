# Design First

Architects must think. They must produce the design before the implementation. Howeever that's only possible if the architect master the problem domain and the technology being used. If that does not happen, Proof of Concepts (PoCs) are a great way to explore the problem and the technology before the design is produced.

Writting down the design is also a great way to communicate it to the team and get feedback. The design should be a living document that evolves with the project. IF you jump executing all times you are doing just tatical programing(Philosophy of software design).

If you move before you think, tech debt will happen, bad decisions will happen.
