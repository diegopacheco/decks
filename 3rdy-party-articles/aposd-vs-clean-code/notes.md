## Link

https://github.com/johnousterhout/aposd-vs-clean-code/blob/main/README.md

## Notes

- Clean code can lead to Over-Decomposition which is bad
- Comments explain WHY for non obvious vs Clean code with no comment just giving "clues" to the reader
- Clean code sometimes break methods with side effects which is bad.
- TDD is too tactical
- Clean Code Misses Trade-offs
