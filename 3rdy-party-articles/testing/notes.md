## Notes

- Microsoft
- Story from Sky for Xbox in 2014
	- Where devs come from gaming and did not write unit tests
	- Devs outsourced unit tests to QA
	- 12 Devs, 6 QA
- US vs Them division
- Ticket ping pong between dev and QA
- In 2024, Skype for web, they had 6 devs and 3 QA, they made they all become devs because there was no sense have a dedicated QA
- Team become more productive by removing QA
	- QA pickup dev tests
	- Paring a lot
	- QA FIX a bug that it found
- 2014 - MS remove the QA Role
	- “At Bing, the task of creating programmatic tests was moved onto developers, instead of dedicated testers. QA still exists and is still important, but it performs end-user style "real world" testing, not programmatic automated testing. This testing has been successful for Bing, improving the team's ability to ship changes without harming overall software quality.”
	- QA Layoff and role renamed to SE: Software Engineer
